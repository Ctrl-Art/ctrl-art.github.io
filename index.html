<p>What do you say we make some art together? <a href="http://joshjet.com/">Josh Michaels</a> and <a href="http://mmmlabs.com/">Surya Buchwald</a> are curating a show of interactive digital art at a new space in downtown Portland in the first week of August. We’re very excited to bring interactive art to an open street level gallery for the public to enjoy.</p>

<p>We're creating a space full of interactive art that all responds to touch input coming from a single source in the room. We’ll do this by providing a stream of <a href="http://tuio.org/">TUIO data</a> which provides a standard way of describing touches over a network.</p>

<a name="some-details" class="anchor" href="#some-details"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Some Details</h3>

<p>We still have many details to work out, here is what we know:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a venue for the show thanks to Josh, who has rented a gallery space across from Ground Kontrol in Portland for a year! The space includes a street level window which will showcase interactive art year round.
We want to have at least two hack days where we can all work on our projects, inspire each other and run some preliminary network tests. We plan on one in June and another in July, if people want to host more that would be great.</li>
<li>We will provide a demo project in Processing to get you up and running quickly, you can use whatever tools you want.</li>
<li>We assume most projects will be displayed on screens, tablets and projectors - if you want to use another medium we may be able to make special accommodation.</li>
<li>We plan to have many projects like this. We may limit scope on suggested features, number of artists participating etc. to make sure things go smoothly, there will be plenty of chance to add further complexity and incorporate more people in the future.</li>
